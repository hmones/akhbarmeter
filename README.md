[MediaMeter (AkhbarMeter)](https://akhbarmeter.org) is one of the first dynamic digital media observatory in Egypt and the world, which rank news agencies according to their adherance to ethical and processional media standards. MediaMeter, is a youth-led initiative developed by Egyptians. The initiative started in 2014 in response to increasing use of media to spread fear among citizens, manipulate the public and polarize society.

### What do we currently do

MediaMeter (AkhbarMeter) currently operates in Egypt. The project monitors and assesses the truthfulness and professionalism of the top ten online news agencies based on Alexa and SimilarWeb rankings. Reviewers assess articles from the digital news agencies based on several methodological questions developed in consultation with various international fact-checking experts and which can be modified in the code making it easily deployed in other settings. The questions fall under three broad categories of professionalism, manipulation, and violations to human rights. Specific questions include whether the article conceals information, contains false information, uses photos to manipulate facts, cites sources representing different views, reflects bias by the author, contains hate speech, negatively profiles members of certain groups, and more. Assessed articles are posted on the website (https://akhbarmeter.org/) along with responses to the questions described above. Each reviewed article is marked with an icon that provides a score out of 100% on how professional and truthful it is. If the article contains false or misinformation, the icon is marked accordingly to warn readers. MediaMeter staff often contact authors of reviewed articles to give them a chance to respond to the evaluation and offer to publish their responses on the articleâ€™s page on the website.
